<h1>The ULTRASPEC Java client/server, version 1.0.0</h1>

<p>
ULTRASPEC, which is based on ULTRACAM, is operated by sending commands to its servers which listen
on several ports. <strong>usdriver</strong> is a program to do this. 
Some of the commands send XML files which define multiple properties. These are
known as 'applications'.

<p>
<strong>usdriver</strong> does the following:
<ul>

<li> Defines the XML application files which are used to drive ULTRASPEC. The setup is done from a GUI.

<li> Allows some user-defined information can be added, such as target name,
filters, grating.

<li> Allows the applications to be loaded from and saved to local disk files.

<li> Acts as a server for 'rtplot' so that the latter can grab the current set of windows.

<li> Posts XML applications and other commands to the ultraspec camera and data servers

</ul>

<h2><a name="installation">Installing the software</a></h2>

<p>
If you already have <strong>usdriver</strong> installed, check the version number and then
look at this <a href="CHANGES.html">list of changes</a> to see if you
need to update it.

<p>
If you have not installed it before, as long as you have Java version 1.4 or later available (so that the system
recognises the commands 'java', 'javac' and 'jar'), installation
should be straightforward (on UNIX systems that is). Download the file <a
href="http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/software/usdriver.tar.gz">usdriver.tar.gz</a>
(always the most up-to-date version), 'tar xvfz' it. It will create a directory
such as usdriver-1.0.0; cd to it, and type 'make'. If that works and the script
it generates works, then define an environment variable TRM_JAVA to point at 
a directory to install, and then type 'make install'.

<p>
At the end of the installation, you will be told how to run the software;
you may want to define an alias. Note that the make also defines an alias
for a directory such as usdriver-1.0.0 == usdriver so that you can define
an alias that always points to the most recently installed version.

<h2><a name="structure">Basic structure</a></h2>

<p>
<strong>usdriver</strong> works around a
basis set of "template applications" and allows you to change a subset of the
parameters of these. At the moment there is only one such application and
so you never even get a choice. This is the ccd201_winbin application which
allows one or two windows. When either you post
or save the application, <strong>usdriver</strong> finds the "4 windows" template, loads it,
edits it to match your choices and then continues. This places an installation 
onus on getting the template files right, and in the right place, but allows one
to switch quickly between different applications with the same sets of windows.
In this sense it is window-centred rather than application centred and is meant
to reflect the way one thinks at a telescope more. 


<h2><a name="configuration">Configuration file</a></h2>

<p>
Once you have installed and used the software, you may want to customise its
behaviour on startup. Many aspects of <strong>usdriver</strong> can be defined using an ASCII configuration
file. The file is called <a href="usdriver.conf">usdriver.conf</a> and 
is kept along with the <i>usdriver</i> script in the installation 
directory's bin sub-directory. Several aspects set by the config file can be
altered as the program is run in its <strong>Settings</strong> menu,
but you may sometimes prefer to alter the configuration file so that a
particular behaviour is there as soon as you start. For instance, if you are
not observing, you might want to set the ULTRACAM servers to be <strong>off</strong>.

<p>
<a href="usdriver.conf">usdriver.conf</a> is written in ASCII and is
self-explanatory. By default the program looks for the configuration file in the
same directory as the program is stored in. You can override this behaviour by
invoking the script in the following manner
<pre>
usdriver full_path_to_an_alternative_config_file
</pre>
(assuming that you have defined the usdriver alias as suggested above). Do not use
a relative path to the file because the script runs the program from the
directory containing it, not the working directory.

<h2><a name="settings">Settings menu</a></h2>

<p>
This menu contains a set of switches that can be toggled on and off to vary how
the program varies. Their initial values are set in the configuration file.
'Expert mode' is described in more detail below. 'Templates from server' means
that the template files used to define the different modes are taken from a
standard location on the machine hosting the server (i.e. the rack PC when
observing) rather than from local copies. This should be slightly safer. The
local option is really for development and testing purposes; if the server is
being used, many other files are still retrieved from a standard location 
on the server whether or not you check this flag.

<p>
'ULTRACAM servers on' indicates that the data and camera servers exist. It does
not turn them on and off. All commands which deal with the servers will be
disabled if this is toggled off.

<p>
'File logging' means that the more useful of the items that appear in the
lower-left information panel will be saved to disk as an html file. This is
a potentially useful store of information. I recommend that it is always
switched on during observing. When you switch it on, you get the chance to 
choose the file name.

<p>
'Show responses as text' just refers to the way the XML responses from the server
are displayed in the lower-right panel. They can either be shown as text or in
tree form.

<p>
'Confirm target name' is a safety device to increase the chances that you have
entered the right target name, as it is fairly important that you get it right.
The idea is that if the settings have changed without the target name changing, then
you will be asked to confirm that the target name is OK.

<h2><a name="expert">Expert mode</a></h2>

<p>
For safety, certain commands enable or disable other commands. Thus,
you will not be able to start an exposure until you have posted it,
or stop one until you have started it. These controls have the
potential to get in the way, although with ULTRACAM at least, this 
has not occurred, and so there is a no-holds-barred
"Expert" mode which will allow you to do anything you like, with
some potential for disaster.

<h2><a name="setup">Setup & Observing panels</a></h2>

<p>
These are two panels on the left-hand side that can be flipped between by
clicking on named tabs.  They group the commands into the ones used to set
ULTRASPEC up and the ones that are used during observing when everything is going
OK. 

<h3>Observing panel</h3>

<p>
This is the main panel to be used during observing. 
It has the following commands:

<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td><i>Load application</i></td>
<td>This loads window settings from a disk file. This will change the
settings of the top right panel. The values can be immediately be
changed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Save application</i></td>
<td>This writes the current window settings to disk. If you have used
the settings for a run, saving them will then make it possible to edit
the settings which will otherwise be frozen. This is a safety
precaution to ensure that all settings used are saved.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Unfreeze application</i></td>
<td>In non-expert mode, the window settings are frozen when they have been used for a run
and can only be unfrozen by saving them to disk, or, as a quick fix, by pressing
this button. The freezing is there for a reason so during observing you should
be saving applications rather than using this button.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Sync windows</i></td>
<td>When you bin the CCD, then it is possible to have identically
binned windows which are nevertheless out of step with each other. For
instance one window may have xbin=2, with unbinned pixels 4-5, 6-7,
8-9 etc ending up added together, while another may have 3-4, 5-6, 7-8
etc. These two windows are incompatible for adding together etc. In addition,
with ULTRASPEC, although it is not enforced, one would normally want the xstart
and nx values to be the same. To help make sure that you DO use
compatible windows, the 'sync windows' button will be highlighted in
orange whenever you choose incompatible settings with a standard
setting for your chosen binning factors. Pressing it will immediately 
adjust the windows so that this is the case, or you can just adjust
the windows until the button is no longer highlighted. 
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Post application</i></td>
<td>Before starting a run, the settings must be posted to the servers
using this button. In non-expert mode, the start button will be
disabled until this is pressed.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Start exposure</i></td>
<td>This starts an exposure and will start exposure and disk space
timers in the panel below. In non-expert mode, this will also enable
the stop button.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Stop exposure</i></td>
<td>This stops whatever exposure is going.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h3>Setup panel</h3>

<p>
This comes in two forms, expert and non-expert. The expert commands
are listed in the order that they should be carried out. They are

<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td><i>Reset SDSU</i></td>
<td>This sends the command 'RCO' to the 
camera server to reset the SDSU controller.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Reset PCI board</i></td>
<td>This sends the command 'RST' to the 
camera server to reset the PCI board.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Setup the servers</i></td>
<td>This sends setup applications to the camera and data servers. The
XML responses will be sent to the lower-right information panel.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Power on</i></td>
<td>This executes the power on application, and then sends the 'GO'
command to run it.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
In non-expert mode, the commands are <strong>Initialise</strong>,
which combines the first four of the commands above in one sequence,
and <strong>Reset</strong> which combines the two reset commands.

<h2><a name="windows">Window parameters panel</a></h2>

<p>
The panel on the top-right defines all the settings needed to run
ULTRASPEC. If there are ever more than one basic application type, then there
would be a menu of them at the top. Following this, or heading the list when
there is no such menu, comes a little drop-down list defining the CCD output, (normal output
or the avalanche gain output). If you select the avalance gain, then you can
set it from 0 (none) to 9 (max). Then comes a readout speed selector, whether
you want to clear the chip, a setting for the internal LED and then parameters
to define the windows and the exposure. Below these are text inputs which are
written to the XML file for the run as crude headers. 
The numerical fields have several features which it is worth knowing.

<h2><a name="numerical">Numerical parameter input</a></h2>

<p>
The parameter values defining the windows are entered on the right-hand part of
the GUI; see <a href="screenshot1.jpg">this screenshot</a>. You do
<strong>NOT</strong> have to hit 'enter' to register values. Instead the values
shown in the GUI are always the values that will be used if you save or post an
application.  A process runs which checks the current window parameters every
second and estimates timing parameters from them which are displayed in
the right-hand side. This process will also flag any problem values that lead to
invalid window settings. If such problems are flagged, then you will not be
able to send anything to the cameras.

<p>
The numerical parameters support the following features:
<ul>

<li> Minimum and maximum values. You will not be allowed to set a value
outside this range. Hit the middle mouse button when on a field to see
its allowed range.

<li> Increment and decrement using the up & down arrow keys and the
left and right mouse buttons.

<li> 'Focus-follows-mouse' behaviour, i.e. as soon as you move the mouse
onto a field, you can start to edit it. This means that you do not have to click
the mouse on a field, so that clicking always implies an increment/decrement operation.

<li> Automatic continuous increment / decrement by holding down the
respective arrow keys or mouse buttons. 

<li> Acceleration of the automatic changes by a factor of 10 by holding down the SHIFT key at
the same time, and by a factor of 50 by holding down both the SHIFT and
CTRL keys.

</ul>

<h2><a name="trouble">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<p>
The GUI attempts to work out which commands are possible, e.g. to prevent you
sending 'start run' twice in a row to the servers. It is possible that it will 
get confused, with the result that it might prevent you from
doing something that you know to be possible. To get round this, switch to
'Expert mode' (can be set in the configuration file or from the 'Settings' menu)
which will remove all safety checks. Once you have managed to execute the command
you want, it should be possible to switch back into the checked,
non-expert mode and carry on.

<p>
A related feature is that you may find that sometimes all of the
windows settings buttons are disabled. This occurs when you have used a given
setup to make a run but have not saved it to disk. Because it could be
useful to be able to recover the setup for a run, this is a safety
measure to ensure that you do save all setups. Again, this check is
removed in expert mode and a temporary side-step around having to save
it can be made if you As it is potentially annoying
however, this behaviour is configurable both in the configuration file
or through the settings menu.

<p>
It is important to understand that the client <strong>is not</strong> ULTRASPEC.
It merely sends information to and receives data back from the ULTRASPEC servers
using http requests.  Thus you can CTRL-C or hit the exit button and ULTRASPEC
will carry on unchanged.  e.g. it could carry on exposing. If you did quit the
client for some reason, when re-started the client will start in a default
state that may not represent the state you know ULTRASPEC to be in. For instance,
you may know that ULTRACAM is set up and want to post an application, but the
client won't let you. It is therefore very likely that you should switch to
'Expert mode' in such circumstances. This will allow you send any command,
including ones that should <strong>not</strong> be sent, so take care. As said
above, as soon as you have successfully executed a command in expert mode,
everything should be back to normal, and you can switch back to checked mode
once more. This also means that should you be controlling ULTRASPEC from a
machine that goes down, but you think that the rack PC and ULTRASPEC are still
running, then as long as you have another machine with
<strong>usdriver</strong> installed which can talk to the rack PC over the
network, then you should be able to control ULTRASPEC using it. Again you almost
certainly need to start in 'expert mode', e.g. so that you can stop an
exposure. You could also have two such clients running at the same time (but not
on the same machine unless you change the port used for the rtplot server).

<p>
Therefore when observing, it is a good idea to install the client on all
laptops (running in expert mode by default) as well as the ULTRASPEC data PC 
in case the latter falls over, as it has done in the past. Similarly, it would 
a seaman-like precaution always to have a laptop connected to the rack PC while 
observing.

<p>
Finally the nature of the client means that it is possible to alter
parameters while an exposure is running with no ill effect. ULTRASPEC will only
have its windows set up when you have posted the application. In the non-expert
mode, you will not be allowed to post an application while an exposure is taking
place.
